# password-generator
Create an application that an employee can use to `generate a random password`

## Overview

By modifying starter code - create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I will have written. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
