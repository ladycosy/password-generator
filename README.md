# password-generator
Create an application that employees can use to `generate a random password` which contains combination of characters. 

## Overview

By modifying starter code - create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. The user will provide an input to select how many characters the password will have (from 10 to 64) and which type of characters they want to include (special, numeric, uppercased, lowercased). 

The app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated `HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code` that I will have written. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
